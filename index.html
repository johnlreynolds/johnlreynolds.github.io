        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I am a graduate student studying for my Ph. D in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, with a focus on Politics and Institutions. I am also a Captain in the U.S. Army. My research interests are bureaucracy, American political institutions, and civil service behavior. For my dissertation I intend to examine how the federal bureaucracy would work to ensure a domestic food supply during a large-scale world war. I intend to graduate from Harvard in the Spring of 2028. Following that, I will become an Associate Professor of American Politics at West Point.<p>

        <p>Prior to attending Harvard, I graduate with a double B.S. in American Politics and Arabic from the United States Military Academy at West Point. I have served as an Armor Officer in Fort Benning, GA, Fort Riley, KS, and Fort Carson, CO, deploying to Korea twice. </p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, going to movies, and watching Army football and the Pittsburgh Steelers. </p>
